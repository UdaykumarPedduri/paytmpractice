Toshiba Corporation (株式会社東芝, Kabushikigaisha Tōshiba, English: /təˈʃiːbə, 
tɒ-, toʊ-/[3]), commonly known as Toshiba and stylized as TOSHIBA, is a Japanese 
multinational conglomerate corporation headquartered in Minato, Tokyo, Japan.
 Its diversified products and services include power, industrial and social 
infrastructure systems, elevators and escalators, electronic components, 
semiconductors, hard disk drives (HDD), printers, batteries, lighting, as well 
as IT solutions such as quantum cryptography which has been in development at 
Cambridge Research Laboratory, Toshiba Europe, located in the United Kingdom, 
now being commercialised.[4][5][6] It was one of the biggest manufacturers of 
personal computers, consumer electronics, home appliances, and medical equipment. 
As a semiconductor company and the inventor of flash memory, Toshiba had been one 
of the top 10 in the chip industry until its flash memory unit was spun off as 
Toshiba Memory, later Kioxia, in the late 2010s.[7][8][9]

The Toshiba name is derived from its former name, Tokyo Shibaura Denki K.K. 
(Tokyo Shibaura Electric Co., Ltd) which in turn was a 1939 merger between 
Shibaura Seisaku-sho (founded in 1875) and Tokyo Denki (founded in 1890). 
The company name was officially changed to Toshiba Corporation in 1978. 
It is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where it was i
a constituent of the Nikkei 225 and TOPIX 100 indices (leaving both in 
August 2018, but returned to the latter in 2021), and the Nagoya Stock Exchange.
