Lenovo Group Limited, often shortened to Lenovo (/ləˈnoʊvoʊ/ lə-NOH-voh, 
Chinese: 联想; pinyin: Liánxiǎng), is a Chinese[8] multinational technology 
company specializing in designing, manufacturing, and marketing consumer electronics, 
personal computers, software, business solutions, and related services. Products 
manufactured by the company include desktop computers, laptops, tablet computers, 
smartphones, workstations, servers, supercomputers, electronic storage devices, 
IT management software, and smart televisions. Its best-known brands include its 
ThinkPad business line of laptop computers (acquired from IBM), the IdeaPad, Yoga, 
and Legion consumer lines of laptop computers, and the IdeaCentre and ThinkCentre

Lenovo was founded in Beijing on 1 November 1984 as Legend by a team of engineers 
led by Liu Chuanzhi and Danny Lui.[11] Initially specializing in televisions, 
the company migrated towards manufacturing and marketing computers. Lenovo grew 
to become the market leader in China and raised nearly US$30 million in an initial 
public offering on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Since the 1990s, Lenovo has 
increasingly diversified from the personal computer market and made a number of corporate 
acquisitions, with the most notable being acquiring and integrating most of IBM's 
personal computer business and its x86-based server business as well as creating its own smartphone.
