HP Inc. is an American multinational information technology company 
headquartered in Palo Alto, California, that develops personal computers (PCs), 
printers and related supplies, as well as 3D printing solutions.

It was formed on November 1, 2015, renamed from the personal computer and printer
 divisions of the original Hewlett-Packard Company, with that company's enterprise 
product and business services divisions becoming Hewlett Packard Enterprise. The split 
was structured so that Hewlett-Packard changed its name to HP Inc. and spun off Hewlett 
Packard Enterprise as a new publicly traded company. HP Inc. retains Hewlett-Packard's 
pre-2015 stock price history and its former stock ticker symbol, HPQ, while Hewlett 
Packard Enterprise trades under its own symbol, HPE.[2][3]

HP is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the S&P 500 Index. 
It is the world's 2nd largest personal computer vendor by unit sales as of January 2021, 
after Lenovo.[4] In the 2018 Fortune 500 list, HP is ranked 58th largest United States 
corporation by total revenue.[5]
